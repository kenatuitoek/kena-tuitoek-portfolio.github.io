Hi, I'm **Kena Tuitoek**, an MSc Data Science & Public Policy student at UCL with a background in economics. I work at the intersection of **machine learning, causal inference and economic/financial applications**.

This site is a living portfolio of my projects and notes. Here you'll find: 

- **Machine learning case studies** - end-to-end pipelines for prediction, model evaluation, and experimentation.
- **Econometrics & policy analysis** - gravity models of trade, carbon pricing & trade, and other applied empirical projects.
- **Writing & notes** – short posts where I document methods, ideas, and reflections as I learn.

I’m currently exploring **2026 opportunities** in:

- Machine learning / quantitative research roles  
- Systematic & data-driven roles in finance and tech  
- Research assistant / pre-doc positions in economics and data science  

If you’d like to connect, collaborate, or discuss any of these projects, feel free to reach out via
