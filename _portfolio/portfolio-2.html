### Overview

Analysed sector-level trade and carbon pricing data to explore how carbon taxes
and the EU ETS/CBAM affect exports in energy-intensive, trade-exposed sectors.

### What I did

- Merged trade data with carbon pricing indicators across multiple jurisdictions.
- Built sector-level panels and visualised trends in carbon prices vs exports.
- Explored differences between covered vs non-covered sectors.
- Summarised findings for coursework / dissertation work.

### Methods & tools

- **Econometrics / stats:** panel data analysis, visualisation  
- **Software:** R / Python (pandas, ggplot / matplotlib)  
- **Data:** trade flows, World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard, EU ETS / CBAM info
