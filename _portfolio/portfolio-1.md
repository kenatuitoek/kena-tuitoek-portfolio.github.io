### Overview

I built a product-level panel of African bilateral trade flows and estimated
gravity models using PPML with high-dimensional fixed effects to quantify how
WTO membership and regional trade agreements shape trade integration.

### What I did

- Constructed a ~960k-observation panel from CEPII trade data and policy data.
- Implemented PPML with exporter–year and importer–year fixed effects in Stata.
- Compared the partial effects of WTO membership vs. regional trade agreements.
- Produced tables and visualisations that formed the core of my dissertation.

### Methods & tools

- **Econometrics:** Gravity models, PPML, high-dimensional fixed effects  
- **Software:** Stata (`ppmlhdfe`), R/Python for cleaning and plots  
- **Data:** CEPII bilateral trade, WTO/PTA indicators
